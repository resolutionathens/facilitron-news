    question: >-
      How much does it cost to use Facilitron platform for my internal facility
      usage?
  - answer: >-
      Yes. For example, you can have different rates for profit and non-profit
      organizations. You can also define special rates for youth or senior
      organizations or for any other organization type you serve. There is no
      limit to the number of type of rates you can set up - just be careful not
      to make it too confusing for your renters.
    question: >-
      Can I set up different rates based on the type of organization that rents
      the facility?
  - answer: Yes.
    question: >-
      Can I have different rates based on time of the day, days of the week,
      holidays, etc?
  - answer: >-
      Yes. You can include some of those into the rental rates you charge or set
      up separate rates for any additional services and equipment you may offer.
      Equipment can range from small items like chairs and tables, to theater
      lighting/sound systems and scoreboards. Services may include custodial,
      security, catering, etc. You can set up either hourly, daily or flat fees.
    question: Can I charge for additional equipment and services?
  - answer: >-
      Based on their preference and in line with facilities’ requirements,
      renters can pay by a major credit card, PayPal, or by check/invoice. All
      payment processing and Account Receivable functions are handled by
      Facilitron.
    question: What form of payment can renters use when booking a facility?
  - answer: >-
      Yes. They can also specify different configuration/set up requirements for
      each facility in the booking.
    question: Can my renters book multiple facilities in a single request?
  - answer: >-
      A renter can add facilities from multiple owners into the shopping cart.
      However, during the check out processing, Facilitron will split them into
      separate transactions - one for each facility owner.
    question: >-
      Can a renter book facilities from multiple facility owners in a single
      request?
  - answer: >-
      Yes, you do. You can change your messaging, logo, colors, slideshow,
      featured facilities and more.
    question: Do I get a custom web page with a direct URL? What can I customize?
  - answer: >-
      Facility owners define their insurance requirements. After that, the
      renter will need to add you to their existing liability coverage and add
      the proof of insurance to the booking request. Alternatively, a renter can
      purchase insurance through our preferred insurance provider (Southwest
      Insurance Brokers) under a policy already issues based on your
      requirements. This option simplifies and streamlines the booking process,
      particularly for smaller organizations, who don't have wherewithal to deal
      with this complexity.
    question: Who provides liability insurance?
  - answer: >-
      Yes. A facility owner can modify virtually any aspect of the order at any
      time - before it’s been approved of even after. Some changes may result in
      different charges and dates of use and require approval of the renter. The
      record of renter approvals (or disapprovals) is permanently kept with the
      booking record history.
    question: Can I modify the booking once it’s been submitted?
  - answer: It's blue.
    question: What color is the sky?
