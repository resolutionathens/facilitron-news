      Non-profit organizations must supply their FEIN (Federal Employer
      Identification Number) and have it verified in the system to qualify for
      non-profit status.  Please note, not all colleges and districts have
      non-profit rates.
    question: >-
      My organization is a non-profit so I signed up for a non-profit account,
      but I’m not receiving the non-profit rate.  How do I receive the
      non-profit rate? 
  - answer: >-
      Non-profit organizations MUST be verified using their federally issued EIN
      to qualify for non-profit rates.  You must register your organization as a
      non-profit with the federal government and supply the EIN to qualify. 
      Please note, not all colleges and districts have non-profit rates.  
    question: >-
      My organization is a non-profit but we don’t have a government issued FEIN
      (Federal Employer Identification Number).  Can I sign up as a non-profit?
  - answer: Contact support to have your FEIN added to your account.
    question: >-
      I didn’t have the FEIN when I signed up as a non-profit, but now I have
      it.  How can I update my account?
  - answer: >-
      Any organization who receives a rate other than the commercial rate MUST
      have their organization assigned to that rate category with school
      approval.  To request a special rate category, add a comment to your
      reservation upon checkout to have your rate reviewed,  Or you may contact
      customer support to request a special rate category.  If you have already
      completed your reservation request, you may also add a comment in the
      reservation’s communication portal.
    question: >-
      My organization isn’t a non-profit but it receives a special rate from my
      school district.  How do I receive this rate?
  - answer: >-
      Organizations that aren’t non-profit or do not qualify for a particular
      rate category other than commercial, will be assigned the commercial
      rate.  Please note, not all colleges and districts have non-profit rates.
    question: >-
      My organization isn’t a technically a commercial business, but it’s not a
      non-profit either.  What rate do I receive?
  - answer: >-
      An individual account is for persons who are requesting to use public
      facilities on behalf of themselves and not on behalf of an organization. 
      A person who is associated with one or more organizations may request on
      behalf of any of those organizations OR on behalf of themselves (if the
      request is for the personal use of facilities).
    question: >-
      What’s the difference between an individual account and a non-profit or
      commercial account?
  - answer: >-
      Yes, if you know your organization already has a Facilitron account and
      you would like your Individual Account to be associated with that
      organization, you may request access to that organization.  Go to
      Facilitron.com and click “Sign Up” and select “Administrator” as the
      Account Type.  Fill in your information including your organization name
      and ZIP code and our customer support team will begin the process of
      adding you to your organization’s account.
    question: >-
      What if my organization already has an account? Can I be added to the
      account?
  - answer: >-
      To have your account associated with an existing organization (and inherit
      its account settings and history), you must be added as a user by the
      account administrator.  For assistance, contact support. 
    question: >-
      I’m the incoming president of my organization but I can’t access my
      organization’s account. How do I have my account associated with my
      organization?
  - answer: >-
      You may search for a specific school name in the search bar at
      facilitron.com.  Or you may go to the specific school’s website and look
      for facility rental information and the link to their Facilitron facility
      storefront.  
    question: >-
      I want to make a request at a specific school.  How do I search among just
      that school’s facilities?
  - answer: >-
      Schools set the availability of their facilities based on school schedules
      and policies.  If a facility shows no availability, there may be several
      reasons why – for example, the school may not have released public
      availability yet, or the facility may be undergoing maintenance or
      repairs.  You may contact support to find out if there’s more information
      about a given facility.
    question: >-
      I found the facility I want to request, but there appears to be no
      availability for any dates or times.  Is the facility not available?
  - answer: >-
      No.  One reservation can consist of multiple dates and/or multiple
      facilities.  For example, if you’re requesting every Sunday from January
      thru June, your request can be configured to include 24 Sundays over 6
      months.  Or if you were requesting the cafeteria and 3 classrooms for one
      or multiple dates, all the requests go on one reservation.
    question: >-
      I want to request multiple dates or multiple facilities.  Do I need to
      make a separate reservation request for each date and/or each facility?
  - answer: >-
      Payment in full isn’t required until after the request has been approved. 
      Then, typically payment is due in full 1 month from event date unless
      otherwise outlined by district policy.  
    question: I just submitted a request.  When will I have to pay in full?
  - answer: >-
      Public school fees presented during checkout are calculated per board
      policy for the particular rate schedule, time and date of a request. 
      These fees are reviewed by the district at the time of approval and can be
      changed by the district administrator.  Any adjustments will be reflected
      at the time of approval. 
    question: >-
      Are the estimated fees showing during checkout the final fees for my
      reservation?
  - answer: >-
      Fees for services that are not requested are essentially REQUIRED services
      that school districts mandate to be added to requests for use of
      facilities.  Services like these - custodial, event manager, utilities or
      restrooms - represent additional costs that districts incur and can be
      adjusted or waived only at the discretion of the district.
    question: >-
      My request added services that I didn’t request.  Are these fees necessary
      and can they be waived? 
  - answer: >-
      Yes Facilitron can invoice you for the full amount, or with an ongoing
      reservation, partial amounts can be invoiced (subject to district policy)
    question: Can I be invoiced?
  - answer: 'Insurance is due at the same time payment is due. '
    question: When is the insurance due on my reservation?
  - answer: >-
      Yes, in most states Facilitron (through a 3rd party provider) offers event
      insurance on a per event basis that can be added to your reservation
      during checkout. The cost is automatically calculated based on event
      details and meets the requirements of the district  You may also switch to
      Facilitron insurance at any time after you have submitted your request.
    question: 'If I can’t provide my own insurance, are there other options?'
  - answer: >-
      Requests are approved by school or district personnel.  You will receive
      an email notifying you that your request has been approved or declined. 
    question: How do I know if my reservation was approved?
  - answer: >-
      The timeline for decisions by school or district personnel regarding
      reservation requests vary by school or district and may be affected by
      school holidays. Usually districts are reasonably prompt and respond
      within days. If your request hasn’t been answered in a week, you may
      contact support for assistance. Facilitron does not approve requests and
      can only ask school personnel to review a pending reservation request on
      behalf of a renter.
    question: 'How long does it take to get my request approved?  '
  - answer: >-
      Schools understandably make using school facilities for school programs
      their first priority. Therefore on occasion circumstances arise that
      require a school event to take priority over an already approved community
      use request (such as, the basketball team makes the playoffs and has a
      heretofore previously unscheduled home game). In such cases, schools
      usually try to accommodate a different date or a different school in the
      district.  You may also work with customer support to try to reschedule
      your event for a different school or date.
    question: My request was approved but now it has been declined.  What do I do?
  - answer: >-
      Renters may cancel a request at any time before it is approved.  After it
      is approved, it can only be cancelled with district approval.  
    question: What if I need to cancel my reservation?
  - answer: >-
      Renters whose approved reservations meet all requirements for use by the
      district (insurance, payment, etc) should print and bring a copy of their
      Facility Use Permit which can be obtained directly from a link in the
      reservation approval email, or by going to the reservation itself and
      clicking “Permit” at the top of the reservation. 
    question: My request has been approved. What do I bring with me the day of my event?
  - answer: >-
      Insurance requirements are listed during the checkout process and again in
      your reservation detail page.  On your reservation detail page, you see
      the question balloon that lists insurance requirements including the
      certificate holder and coverage amount.  If you have questions about
      insurance, contact support.
    question: What are the liability insurance requirements?
  - answer: >-
      To upload your insurance certificate, you must go to your reservation
      details page.  In the insurance section you will find the insurance
      requirement details and a button to “Upload Certificate” or “Switch To
      Facilitron” insurance - per event coverage that meets district
      requirements.
    question: How do I upload my insurance?
  - answer: >-
      Payment options include major credit cards, PayPal, eChecks, and regular
      check payments (by mail).  To pay, navigate to your reservation details
      page and find the payment section.
