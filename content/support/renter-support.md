      1. Check your spam, junk or bulk mail folders to see if the verification
      email is there


      2. Next, ensure that your spam blocker is not filtering
      no-reply@facilitron.com (you may add this email to your address book)

      spelled correctly.

      Non-profit organizations must supply their FEIN (Federal Employer
      Identification Number) and have it verified in the system to qualify for
      non-profit status.  Please note, not all colleges and districts have
      non-profit rates.
    question: 'My organization is a non-profit.  How do I receive the non-profit rate?  '
  - answer: >-
      Non-profit organizations MUST be verified using their federally issued EIN
      to qualify for non-profit rates.  You must register your organization as a
      non-profit with the federal government and supply the EIN to qualify. 
      Please note, not all colleges and districts have non-profit rates.  
    question: >-
      My organization is a non-profit but we don’t have a government issued FEIN
      (Federal Employer Identification Number).  How do I receive the non-profit
      rate?
  - answer: >-
      Any organization who receives a rate other than the commercial rate MUST
      have their organization assigned to that rate category with school
      approval.  To request a special rate category, add a comment to your
      reservation upon checkout to have your rate reviewed,  Or you may contact
      customer support to request a special rate category.  If you have already
      completed your reservation request, you may also add a comment in the
      reservation’s communication portal.
    question: >-
      My organization isn’t a non-profit but it receives a special rate from my
      school district.  How do I receive this rate?
  - answer: >-
      Organizations that aren’t non-profit or do not qualify for a particular
      rate category other than commercial, will be assigned the commercial
      rate.  Please note, not all colleges and districts have non-profit rates.
    question: >-
      My organization isn’t a technically a commercial business, but it’s not a
      non-profit either.  What rate do I receive?
  - answer: >-
      An individual account is for persons who are requesting to use public
      facilities on behalf of themselves and not on behalf of an organization. 
      A person who is associated with one or more organizations may request on
      behalf of any of those organizations OR on behalf of themselves (if the
      request is for the personal use of facilities).
    question: >-
      What’s the difference between an individual account and a non-profit or
      commercial account?
  - answer: >-
      Yes, if you know your organization already has a Facilitron account and
      you would like your Individual Account to be associated with that
      organization, you may request access to that organization.  Go to
      Facilitron.com and click “Sign Up” and select “Administrator” as the
      Account Type.  Fill in your information including your organization name
      and ZIP code and our customer support team will begin the process of
      adding you to your organization’s account.
    question: >-
      What if my organization already has an account? Can I be added to the
      account?
  - answer: >-
      To have your account associated with an existing organization (and inherit
      its account settings and history), you must be added as a user by the
      account administrator.  For assistance, contact support. 
    question: >-
      I’m the incoming president of my organization but I can’t access my
      organization’s account. How do I have my account associated with my
      organization?
