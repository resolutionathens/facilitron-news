      Yes, all requests must come from an Individual or an Organization.  You
      may create an account by clicking “Sign Up” at Facilitron.com and
      selecting Individual, Non-Profit, or Commercial as your Account Type.
    question: Do I have to create an account to reserve a facility?
  - answer: >
      If you did not receive a Facilitron account creation verification email,
      try the following:

      1. Check your spam, junk or bulk mail folders to see if the verification
      email is there


      2. Next, ensure that your spam blocker is not filtering
      no-reply@facilitron.com (you may add this email to your address book) 


      3. Check to ensure the email address you entered for your account is
      spelled correctly.


      4. If all else fails, contact support.
