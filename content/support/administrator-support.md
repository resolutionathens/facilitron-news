      If you did not receive a Facilitron account creation verification email,
      try the following:

      1.  Check your spam, junk or bulk mail folders to see if the verification
      email is there


      2.  Next, ensure that your spam blocker is not filtering
      no-reply@facilitron.com (you may add this email to your address book)
       
      3.  Check to ensure the email address you entered for your account is
      spelled correctly.


      4.  If all else fails, contact support.
    question: >-
      I created an account but I didn’t receive my account verification email. 
      What can I do?
  - answer: >-
      School employee accounts must be associated with your school and assigned
      a role to gain access to school calendars and scheduling system.  Only
      school admins or Facilitron customer support can do this.  To request
      access, select “Administrator” from the Sign Up menu.  Fill out the form
      and submit.  Someone from customer support will contact you about having
      your account added to your school and assigned a role. Or, you may contact
      your school’s admin and request to be added to the system.
    question: >-
      I’m a school employee and my school is a Facilitron partner. How do I get
      access to Facilitron to schedule school activities?
  - answer: >-
      No.  You should not attempt to create your school as an organization. 
      Existing organizations must have users added by school administrators or
      by Facilitron customer support.  To request access, select “Administrator”
      from the Sign Up menu.   Fill out the form and submit.  Someone from
      customer support will contact you about having your account added to your
      school and assigned a role.
    question: >-
      I’m a school employee and my school is a Facilitron partner.  Can I create
      an account and an organization for my school?
  - answer: >-
      Scheduling requests for events occurring during school hours must be
      created as an “Internal” reservation. You cannot create an internal event
      from the school or district’s public request storefront (featuring search
      results, pictures and descriptions, etc.).  Internal requests can only be
      made from the administrative Dashboard Calendar.  Select “+Event” from the
      top right of the calendar to access the Create Internal Schedule window. 
      For general notices not associated with a particular facility (i.e.
      “Spring Break”), select “+Notice”
    question: >-
      I’m a school employee trying to make a reservation request but I can’t
      request during school hours. Why?
  - answer: >-
      Logged in users at facilitron.com will see Accounts & Dashboard in the
      menu.  In the drop down menu for Accounts & Dashboard will be links to the
      Dashboard and other areas of the administrative back end.
    question: >-
      I’m logged in to Facilitron.  How do I get to the administrative
      dashboard?
  - answer: >-
      To access your school account, select “Other Organizations” on the left
      side of the Dashboard and choose your school.  The school name will appear
      at the top of your Dashboard.  If your school isn’t in the list, then you
      haven’t been added to your school and assigned a role.  To request access,
      contact your school administrator or Facilitron customer support.
    question: >-
      I’m logged in to my Facilitron account but I do not see the school
      calendar when I'm at the Dashboard. What do I do?
