      If you did not receive a Facilitron account creation verification email,
      try the following:

      1.  Check your spam, junk or bulk mail folders to see if the verification
      email is there


      2.  Next, ensure that your spam blocker is not filtering
      no-reply@facilitron.com (you may add this email to your address book)
       
      3.  Check to ensure the email address you entered for your account is
      spelled correctly.


      4.  If all else fails, contact support.
    question: >-
      I created an account but I didn’t receive my account verification email. 
      What can I do?
  - answer: >-
      School employee accounts must be associated with your school and assigned
      a role to gain access to school calendars and scheduling system.  Only
      school admins or Facilitron customer support can do this.  To request
      access, select “Administrator” from the Sign Up menu.  Fill out the form
      and submit.  Someone from customer support will contact you about having
      your account added to your school and assigned a role. Or, you may contact
      your school’s admin and request to be added to the system.
    question: >-
      I’m a school employee and my school is a Facilitron partner. How do I get
      access to Facilitron to schedule school activities?
  - answer: >-
      No.  You should not attempt to create your school as an organization. 
      Existing organizations must have users added by school administrators or
      by Facilitron customer support.  To request access, select “Administrator”
      from the Sign Up menu.   Fill out the form and submit.  Someone from
      customer support will contact you about having your account added to your
      school and assigned a role.
    question: >-
      I’m a school employee and my school is a Facilitron partner.  Can I create
      an account and an organization for my school?
  - answer: >-
      Scheduling requests for events occurring during school hours must be
      created as an “Internal” reservation. You cannot create an internal event
      from the school or district’s public request storefront (featuring search
      results, pictures and descriptions, etc.).  Internal requests can only be
      made from the administrative Dashboard Calendar.  Select “+Event” from the
      top right of the calendar to access the Create Internal Schedule window. 
      For general notices not associated with a particular facility (i.e.
      “Spring Break”), select “+Notice”
    question: >-
      I’m a school employee trying to make a reservation request but I can’t
      request during school hours. Why?
  - answer: >-
      Logged in users at facilitron.com will see Accounts & Dashboard in the
      menu.  In the drop down menu for Accounts & Dashboard will be links to the
      Dashboard and other areas of the administrative back end.
    question: >-
      I’m logged in to Facilitron.  How do I get to the administrative
      dashboard?
  - answer: >-
      To access your school account, select “Other Organizations” on the left
      side of the Dashboard and choose your school.  The school name will appear
      at the top of your Dashboard.  If your school isn’t in the list, then you
      haven’t been added to your school and assigned a role.  To request access,
      contact your school administrator or Facilitron customer support.  If you
      are at logged in to facilitron.com, you can go to "Accounts and Dashboard"
      drop down and select the appropriate organization under "Switch Accounts"
    question: >-
      I’m logged in to my Facilitron account but I do not see the school
      calendar when I'm at the Dashboard. What do I do?
  - answer: >-
      To view a pending reservation at your school or district, log in to your
      Facilitron account at facilitron.com and select your organization. Or if
      you are already logged in under the correct organization, access the
      "Accounts and Dashboard" drop down and choose "Dashboard." From the
      Dashboard, you will see a section labeled “Pending Reservations” or you
      may select "Reservations" from the side bar menu and choose "Pending
      Reservations."
    question: How do I view the pending reservations at my school or district?
  - answer: >-
      If all the dates of use in a reservation are cancelled, you may ‘Decline’
      the entire reservation to cancel the event. If an individual date of use
      is cancelled (or even several dates, but not all dates) within a
      reservation with multiple dates, you can use the red ‘x’ next to the
      timeslot to cancel individual dates of use.  
    question: How can I cancel an approved event?
  - answer: >-
      No. Email notifications are sent from no-reply@facilitron.com, and should
      not be replied to. In order to reply to an email notification, you can
      click “See Details” next to the reservation ID number or the button “Click
      Here” under the reservation details. Clicking either of these buttons will
      prompt you to login to Facilitron and will direct you to the specific
      reservation where you can make comments and changes in the
      “Comments/History” section.  Otherwise, you should email support.
    question: I received an email notification about a reservation.  Can I reply to it?
  - answer: >-
      The best way to communicate with the renter/requestor, other stakeholders,
      and the Facilitron team is to make a comment directly in the reservation.
      At the bottom of the reservation details page on the left hand side, is a
      section labeled “Comments/History.” Type your comment in the box and
      choose from a variety of sending options below. By selecting internal
      comment, only the District staff and Facilitron team will be able to view
      the comment. If you would like to send the comment to a specific
      recipient, click on the “Select Recipients” box and type the recipient’s
      name. Click the comment button when you are finished and the comment will
      be recorded in the reservation and an email notification will be sent to
      all involved recipients.
    question: >-
      I want to send a message to the requestor and other stakeholders about a
      reservation.  What’s the best way to do that?
  - answer: >-
      Yes. Under the reservation details page on the right hand side is the
      “Calendar” section. Here you will find a list of each date and facility
      being used. In order to delete a date or facility, simply click on the box
      to the right of the timeslot which will highlight the timeslot red.
      Continue to select any times you wish to remove and click the “Delete
      Timeslots” button at the bottom of the section.
    question: >-
      Can I delete a single event in a reservation without deleting the whole
      reservation?
  - answer: >-
      In order to request facilities at another school within your District, go
      to that school's Facilitron rental site. If you do not know the website,
      you can go to facilitron.com and type the school name in the search bar.
      Search or select the facility you are requesting and proceed with the
      check out process. When prompted to log in, make sure you are representing
      your own school to allow school admins to recognize that you are part of
      the same District.
    question: How do I request events at other school sites within my District?
