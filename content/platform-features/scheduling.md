# Manage your calendars from one place

Facilitron gives facility owners unprecedented control and dramatically simplifies the way they manage and rent their facilities.

With Facilitron’s calendar management tools, you can manage event calendars from one place and easily integrate with those already using Google, Apple, MS Outlook or nearly any other calendar.

The Facilitron® platform provides to facility owners a rich set of features designed to accommodate the full spectrum of internal processes required by institutional facility owners. From very simple to most complex workflows requiring multiple levels of approval and pre-approval hierarchies - we will set up the right workflows to suit the exact needs of your organization.
