<p>Not only is a Facilitron partnership designed to help colleges and school districts track and manage recovery costs with no expense, it actually reduces costs by reducing admin time, streamlining requests and offloading burdens such as insurance and organization verifications, payments and refunds.</p>

<h3 class="h3-responisve">Allocating Limited Resources</h3>
<p>Even though community use at most districts is considerable, internal staff to manage requests isn’t. Duties such as non-profit status and insurance verifications, tracking down payment and issuing refunds are burdens that are always lower in priority than day-to-day school business.</p>

<p>Community use of district facilities is often an obligation that creates additional burdens for districts and for various reasons is usually poorly tracked. With decision-making often pushed to individual schools, district oversight regarding which requests are being approved or declined, whether board policies and pricing are being followed, and even whether community partnerships are being overly subsidized by school funds doesn’t exist and can even expose districts to unnecessary liability.</p>
