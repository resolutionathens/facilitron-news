    <h2 class="h2-responsive vertical-callout">How long does it take?</h2>
    <p><b>We move fast</b> and make it easy to get all district facilities configured and key staff trained &mdash; which makes for a smooth transition and launch. Depending on the size of a district and how fast it wants to move, <b>the implementation process can take as little as 1-month</b> for a 100-campus district, or just weeks for a smaller district.</p>
    <p class="f-bullet-title">Implementation Milestones:</p>
    <ul class="f-ul">
      <li><b>Kick Off Meeting</b> – Meeting or call to review implementation process, coordinate site visits and photo schedule, request any remaining materials needed</li>
      <li><b>Photos </b>– Visit school sites to shoot all photos</li>
      <li><b>Site Review </b>- Meeting within one week of photo completion to review account setup and community facing storefront pages</li>
      <li><b>Reservation Review</b> – Meet to review existing reservations in system at launch and train principal admins on reservation management, etc.</li>
      <li><b>Staff Training</b> – Training sessions for all relevant staff in district - group and one-on-one sessions</li>
      <li><b>Go live</b>!</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="h2-responsive vertical-callout">We just went live. Now what?</h2>
    <p> During implementation, we introduce your district’s <b>Account Manager</b> who becomes involved with training key staff and getting to know your district - its renters, its administrators and its policies. AMs then work with the district on a day-to-day basis assisting and supporting <b>to help relieve the burden of routine but time-consuming admin tasks</b> like insurance verification or collections. </p>

    <p>Then, on an ongoing basis, our Account Managers along with our <b>Customer Support</b> continue to assist district administrators, faculty and facility requestors - whether school-related groups or community groups - with day to day questions, ongoing training, best practices, adjustments and more.</p>
    <p class="f-bullet-title">Among the ways AMs and CS representatives assist…</p>
    <ul class="f-ul">
      <li>Onsite training and support for admins</li>
      <li>Reservation adjustments and management assistance </li>
      <li>Invoicing, payment processing, collections, refunds</li>
