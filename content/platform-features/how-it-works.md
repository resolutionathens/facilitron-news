<h2 class="h2-responsive">You May Be Wondering</h2>

<p>Your district just decided to move forward with Facilitron so they can streamline receiving and managing reservation requests and start tracking valuable data on how, when and by whom facilities are being used. Now what?</p>

<h3 class="vertical-callout h3-responsive">Does it really cost nothing?</h3>

<p>Yes, all account creation, storefront setup, schedule ingestion, photos, calendars, training – everything is all part of the Facilitron partnership and comes with NO COSTS.</p>

<h3 class="vertical-callout h3-responsive">What happens first?</h3>

<p>It starts with our amazing Implementation Team. They are responsible for creating your account and configuring it with all your schools and buildings, rates and requirements, services and equipment, and setting up each facility’s general availability as well as existing schedules and reservations.</p>

<p>They also take the 360 photos and aerial shots that make your district look its best.</p>

<h3 class="vertical-callout h3-responsive">We just went live. Now what?</h3>
<p>During implementation, Facilitron introduces your district’s Account Manager(s) who become involved with training key staff and getting to know your district - its renters, its administrators and its policies.  AMs then work with the district on a day-to-day basis assisting and supporting to help relieve the burden of routine but time consuming admin tasks like insurance verification or collections.</p>
<p>Then, on an ongoing basis, Facilitron’s Account Managers along with our Customer Support Team continue to assist district administrators, faculty and facility requestors - whether school-related groups or community groups - with day to day questions, ongoing training, best practices, adjustments and more.</p>
<p>Among the ways Account Mangers and Customer Support Representatives assist:</p>

<ul class="f-ul">
  <li>Onsite training and support for admins</li>
  <li>Reservation adjustments and management assitance</li>
  <li>Invoicing, payment processing, collections, refunds</li>
  <li>Custom reports</li>
  <li>Best practices</li>
  <li>24/7 renter support for new and existing reservations</li>
  <li>Community inquiries and questions</li>
  <li>Insurance and non-profit verification</li>
  <li>Availability and reservation repurposing or rescheduling</li>
  <li>Changes/Edits</li>
  <li>Communications</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="vertical-callout h3-responsive">Ongoing services…</h3>
<p> It doesn’t stop there.  A Facilitron partnership includes ongoing analysis and business insights that enable districts to create policies that have a major impact on the health and performance of schools.  All while allowing for an overlap of resources that benefits both education and the community. </p>
