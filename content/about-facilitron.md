## About Facilitron

Founded in 2014 and headquartered in Silicon Valley, Facilitron is transforming the way facilities are discovered, reserved, rented and used across communities -- all online and accessible from most personal devices. With all-inclusive services and turn-key apps software, venues can easily be managed, listed, discovered and booked on our cloud Marketplace, minimizing rental risks and vacancies for owners, and assuring affordable on-demand access to the right facilities at the right time for the renters.

Whether a K-12 school district, a community college, a Parks & Recreation department, or a university, you can be up and running on our platform in days. Whether a competitive sports club, or a lunch-time team of colleagues, you can sign up and find on our secure Marketplace the best-priced and highest quality venue for your activities in minutes, with short or long-term rental options, and even insurance!
