Fairfield-Suisun Unified School District is pleased to announce a new online facility request and rental system designed to provide our community with an improved user experience. With Facilitron, reservation requests can be submitted easily and will be handled more efficiently. Renters will be able to access photos and descriptions of FSUSD facilities, see real-time availability, get estimated quotes, upload documentation, and
pay fees online.

As part of this move to a more efficient rental process, FSUSD is conducting an in-depth cost analysis of the direct costs for maintaining school facilities as a result of facility use by the community. The Civic Center Act (Ed Code Section 38130) states that a Governing Board of a school district may charge nonprofit organizations whose activities are beneficial to youth or public school activities an amount not to exceed its direct costs for use of its school facilities or grounds. FSUSD intends to charge nonprofit organizations a rate that is half of these
direct costs and increase the rate incrementally over the upcoming years, until 100% direct costs are approved. As a result, some fees may increase and some may decrease.

In accordance with the Civic Center Act, FSUSD has developed a proposed fee schedule. For more information about the potential new rates or the new rental system, the community is encouraged to attend the Governing Board meeting on October 12, 2017 at 2490 Hilborn
Road, Fairfield, CA 94534 at 6:00 p.m., or contact the Facilities and Operations Department at the number indicated below. The proposed fee schedule will be presented to the Governing Board for potential approval on October 26, 2017. Additional information is also posted on the FSUSD website at https://www.fsusd.org/Page/5837.

Implementation of the new rental system is scheduled to begin January 8, 2018, pending Board approval. All requests entered after that date will be subject to the new rates. Facilitron will assist with the set-up of organizational accounts and the verification of non-profit status (if applicable). All payments will be processed through Facilitron. Payment options include PayPal, major credit cards, ACH/eCheck and traditional check. Proof of insurance (COI) can be conveniently uploaded into the platform, and/or it can be obtained directly through Facilitron.

Questions or comments can be directed to the Facilities & Operations Department at (707) 399-5148.
