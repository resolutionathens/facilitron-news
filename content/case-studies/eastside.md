## ESUHSD takes control of their facility rentals
#### Client: East Side Union High School District
#### Challenge: Schools weren't adhering to district guidelines for facility rentals

After an internal review, Marcus Battle, CBO of East Side Union High School District in San
Jose, confirmed what he had suspected – the district’s schools weren’t following a number
of district guidelines regarding external facility rentals. Facility rental pricing was inconsistent
from school to school, reservation requests and approvals weren’t transparent to the district,
and the lack of a centralized calendar system meant the district couldn’t always see events
occurring in their own facilities.

To help resolve the issues, ESUHSD partnered with Facilitron to implement an online
scheduling, rental and facility management system. The new platform allowed the schools to
work alongside the district to transform the previously bottoms-up process into a system that
provides transparency to each important stakeholder. Among the immediate benefits, facility
rental rates have become consistent across the district, and both the schools and the district
are seeing significant time savings and increases in revenue.

“In implementing the Facilitron system, we expected some push back but instead of losing
control, our schools found they have actually been given more control,” said Battle. “We’re
extremely happy with the new system. We’ve saved so much time, it’s really been amazing.”

Including on-boarding and training time, ESUHSD was up and running quickly and thanks to
their new partnership with Facilitron have one centralized place for total facility management
– calendars, communications, reservation requests and more.
