## Access to data drives policy changes and $1 million increase in facility revenues
#### Client: East Side Union High School District

Like many districts across the country, East Side Union High School District and its CBO
Marcus Battle were facing challenging budget cuts and were looking to the facility use
program for possible additional funds. In the first year alone, revenue from community use of
district facilities jumped from $450 thousand to over $2 million as a result of a new focus on
the program and access and efficiencies created by the Facilitron partnership.

“I needed to increase revenue, so I came in and basically asked Facilitron, how can we
maximize and get this number from $2 to $3 million?” said Battle.

Data gathered by Facilitron had already allowed the district establish relative benchmarks for
overall approval rates, and further analysis by Facilitron helped identify district schools whose
rates were out of line with others in the district. The analysis also revealed another area of
leakage – fee adjustments on rentals discounted from school board mandated rates. Current
district policy allowed individual admins at each school to manage and approve external rental
requests leading to inconsistency.

“Access to the data allowed us to change our policies for administering community rental
requests occurring after school hours and bring the responsibility for those requests back to
the district so we could drive more revenue.”

In just a few months, this data-driven policy adjustment has resulted in reduced fee
discounting, higher approval rates and a reduction in approval inconsistencies across schools.
