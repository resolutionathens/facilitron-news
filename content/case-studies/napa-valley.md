## Napa Valley Unified unknowingly subsidized community programs through facility use fees
#### Client: Napa Valley Unified School District
#### Challenge: Find ways to more effectively manage facility use amid budget crunch

---

Facing budget reductions and layoffs, Napa Valley Unified School District turned to their facility use program in search of revenues and ways to alleviate the crunch. Utilization reports and cost analysis by Facilitron using data from just one year on the reservation and scheduling platform allowed the district to more clearly understand the actual cost of using district’s facilities - whether by school programs or the community. The analysis revealed that had actual costs been recovered by the district for community use an additional $2.2M in revenues would have been received. Consequently, the district was _unknowingly subsidizing community programs_ with taxpayer money – _money that can now be reallocated to the classroom_.

“During a period of teacher job reductions and budget cuts, we simply can’t afford to allow the district and taxpayers to subsidize non-school related programs conducted by community groups,” said Ken Spencer, Director of General Services.
