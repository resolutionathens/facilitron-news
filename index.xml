      <description>ESUHSD takes control of their facility rentals Client: East Side Union High School District Challenge: Schools weren&amp;rsquo;t adhering to district guidelines for facility rentals After an internal review, Marcus Battle, CBO of East Side Union High School District in San Jose, confirmed what he had suspected – the district’s schools weren’t following a number of district guidelines regarding external facility rentals. Facility rental pricing was inconsistent from school to school, reservation requests and approvals weren’t transparent to the district, and the lack of a centralized calendar system meant the district couldn’t always see events occurring in their own facilities.</description>
